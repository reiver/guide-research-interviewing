A guide on how to conduct interviews for research. These are the types of interviews that would be done by product researchers, UX designers, business analysts, and software engineers.

There are 6 phases to inteviewing:

* phase 1: unknown-unknowns (just get them to talk)
* phase 2: known-unknowns (ask specific questions)
* phase 3: How could things go wrong?
* phase 4: what do you think others would say or think?
* phase 5: what question didn't I ask you, but should have?
* phase 6: who else should I talk to?

## Phase 1: Unknown-Unknowns

There are known-unknowns, and there are **unknown-unknowns**.

Here is an example of a known-unknown:
> How old are you?

You know I have an age.
And it is **known** to you that you do _not_ know my age.
But (very likely) you don't know how old I am ⁠— i.e., my age is an **unknown** to you.
That is a **known-unknown** — you **know** that my age has some value, but to you it is **unknown** what my age actually is.
But given this is an **known-unknown** you could directly ask me:
> How old are you?

But there are also **unknown-unknows**.

Unknown-unknowns are things that you couldn't directly ask me a question about it, because you don't even realize you don't know it ⁠— i.e., it is **unknown** to you, that these things are **unknown** to you.

Here is an example of an unknown-unknown:
> What material was used to create the pigment use in the paint for the ushabti boxes created by Khabekhnet?

Until you read that sentence, you may very likely have never seen the word “ushabti”, and likely have no idea what a “ushabti box” is.
You probably have also never heard of “Khabekhnet”, and have no idea who he is.

Before reading that sentence, “ushabtis”, “ushabti boxes”, and “Khabekhnet” were **unknown-unknowns** to you.

Before reading that question, you wouldn't have been able to even come up with a direct question about “ushabtis”, “ushabti boxes”, and “Khabekhnet”.

You will experience this a lot when doing **research interviewing**.

And it doesn't matter whether that **research interviewing** is for product-research, or ux-research, or business-analysis, or software-engineering.

**You need to be able to discover _unknown-unknows_!**
