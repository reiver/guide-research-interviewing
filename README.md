A guide on how to conduct interviews for research. These are the types of interviews that would be done by product researchers, UX designers, business analysts, and software engineers.

There are 6 phases to inteviewing:

* [phase 1: unknown-unknowns (just get them to talk)](#phase-1)
* [phase 2: known-unknowns (ask specific questions)](#phase-2)
* [phase 3: how could things go wrong?](#phase-3)
* [phase 4: what do you think others would say or think?](#phase-4)
* [phase 5: what question didn't I ask you, but should have?](#phase-5)
* [phase 6: who else should I talk to?](#phase-6)

## Phase 1

Unknown-Unknowns.

### Example of Known-Unknowns

There are known-unknowns, and there are **unknown-unknowns**.

Here is an example of a known-unknown:
> How old are you?

You know I have an age.
And it is **known** to you that my age is **unknown** to you.
That is a **known-unknown** — you **know** that my age has some value, but to you it is **unknown** what my age actually is.
But given this is an **known-unknown**, you could directly ask me:
> How old are you?

### Example of Unknown-Unknowns

But there are also **unknown-unknows**.

Unknown-unknowns are things that you couldn't directly ask me a question about it, because you don't even realize you don't know it ⁠— i.e., it is **unknown** to you, that these things are **unknown** to you.

Here is an example of an unknown-unknown:
> What material was used to create the pigment use in the paint for the ushabti boxes created by Khabekhnet?

Until you read that sentence, you may very likely have never seen the word “ushabti”, and likely have no idea what a “ushabti box” is.
You probably have also never heard of “Khabekhnet”, and have no idea who he is.

Before reading that sentence, “ushabtis”, “ushabti boxes”, and “Khabekhnet” were **unknown-unknowns** to you.

Before reading that question, you wouldn't have been able to even come up with a direct question about “ushabtis”, “ushabti boxes”, and “Khabekhnet”.

You will experience this a lot when doing **research interviewing**.

And it doesn't matter whether that **research interviewing** is for product-research, or ux-research, or business-analysis, or software-engineering.

### Questions

**You need to be able to discover _unknown-unknows_!**

Here is a way you can go about discovering **unknown-unknows** —

1. ask very open-ended questions, so that you can
2. just get them to start talking;
3. and let them talk;
4. if they stop talking, ask them another open-ended question to get them talking again.

What is an **open-ended question** you might be asking. Good question.

Here is an example of a question that is NOT an open-ended question:
> How old are you?

They will reply with something like:
> 35
And likely _not_ say anything else.

You want them to start talking.
You want them to start talking about things you don't know you need to ask questions about.

Here is an example of an open-ended question:

* Tell me about “X”.
  * Tell me about _your experience as a YouTuber_.
  * Tell me about _what it is like to work at a bank_.
  * Tell me about _underwriting_.
  * Tell me about _EFTs_.
  * etc

(What you replace “X” with will depend on who you are talking to, and what industry or market you are researching.)

Here is an example of another open-ended question?

* What is “X” like?
  * What is _being a YouTuber_ like?
  * What is _working at a bank_ like?
  * What is _underwriting_ like?
  * etc

(Again, what you replace “X” with will depend on who you are talking to, and what industry or market you are researching.)

Questions like these — open-ended questions — are designed to get the person to talk, so that you can discover **unknown-unknowns**.

## Phase 2

Known-Unknows.


ask specific questions

## Phase 3

> **How could things go wrong?**

In **phase 3** that is the question you should ask.

For example —

If you were talking to a _talent agent_ who gets sponsorship deals for the successful YouTubers, you might ask —

> **How could things go wrong?**
> 
> ... with the influncer?
> 
> ... with advertisers?
> 
> ... with anything and any of it?

(Some of how you phrase that is going to depend on the exact field, industry, and market you are focusing on.)


## Phase 4

Sometimes interviewees don't tell you everything, or aren't completely honest.

Maybe answering a question honestly would embarrass them, or make them feel shame, or make them feel guilt.
Maybe answering a question honestly would violate a local taboo.
Etc.

So don't answer honestly.

But you need the truth!

How do you get the truth in case like this —

Here is a strategy for getting that type of information — ask this question —

> **What do you think others would say?**

> **What do you think others think?**


## Phase 5

Once you are done all that, there is another question for you to ask them —

> **What question should I have asked you, but didn't?**

You can only ask this question at the end of the interview.
It won't work at the beginning.

You've been talking to them for a while.
They probably had some thoughts on things they might have thought would be useful for you to know, but the conversation just didn't go that way, and a good time never came up for them to mention it.

You are giving them a chance to mention it by asking them this question.

**Take _lots and lots_ of notes on what they say.**

Also, you can ask this question more than once.

For example, if you ask that once, and then give you an answer, you can then ask:

> **What _other_ question should have I asked you, but didn't?**

You can keep repeating that until they have no more questions.

## Phase 6

At the very end of your interview, after you have asked _all_ those _questions_, and taken _lots and lots_ of _notes_, you need to ask another question —

> **Who else should I talk to?**

> **Who else would you recommend?**

> **Are there a few other people you would recommend I talk to?**

This person you just interviewed probably knows other people in that field in that industry, in that market.
They very likely could recommend other people for you to talk to.

If they give you a list of other people, **write the names of those people down** (and any other information interviewee provides you).

And _after_ than, _after_ they have given you that list of people, then ask:

> **Could you introduce me to them?**

It is usually much easier to get someone to talk to you, if someone they know introduces you to them.

In addition to that, through this strategy, you can find a lot of (relevant) people to interview this way.

For example, if you start with 1 person,
and that person introduces you to 3 people,
and each of those individuals introduced you to 3 more people,
and each of those individuals introduced you to 3 more people —
then that is:
```
1 + 1×3 + ((1×3)×3) + (((1×3)×3)×3) =
1 + 3   + 9         + 27            =
40
```

Before you talk to all these people, yoy will very likely have learned a lot!
