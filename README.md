# GUIDE: Research Interviewing

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

A guide on how to conduct interviews for research. These are the types of interviews that would be done by product researchers, UX designers, business analysts, and software engineers.

This guide will tell you _what_ **questions to ask** the interviewee, and _why_ you should ask those questions.

But note, you need to **takes notes** while you are interviewing the interviewee.
If you don't take notes, you are wasting your time.
Whether you take your notes on a paper, or on a laptop, or on a mobie phone — it doesn't matter — just **take notes**!

There are 8 phases when I _inteview_ someone for _research_:

* [phase 1: unknown-unknowns (just get them to talk)](#phase-1)
* [phase 2: follow-ups](#phase-2)
* [phase 3: known-unknowns (ask specific questions)](#phase-3)
* [phase 4: how could things go wrong?](#phase-4)
* [phase 5: what do you think others would say or think?](#phase-5)
* [phase 6: what question didn't I ask you, but should have?](#phase-6)
* [phase 7: who else should I talk to?](#phase-7)
* [phase 8: write even more notes](#phase-8)

## Phase 1

**Unknown-Unknowns.**

### Example of Known-Unknowns

There are known-unknowns, and there are **unknown-unknowns**.

Here is an example of a known-unknown:
> How old are you?

For example —
You know I have an age, but you don't know what my age is.
And thus, it is **known** to you that my age is **unknown** to you.
That is a **known-unknown** — you **know** that my age has some value, but to you it is **unknown** what my age actually is.

But given this is an **known-unknown**, in a practical sense, you could directly ask me:
> How old are you?

That is one of the _key-points_ of a **known-unknown** — in a practical sense you _could_ **conceive of** and ask **direct questions** learn that.


### Example of Unknown-Unknowns

But there are also **unknown-unknows**.

Unknown-unknowns are things that you couldn't _conceive of_ and then ask me a _direct question_ about it, because you don't even realize you don't know it ⁠— i.e., it is **unknown** to you, that these things are **unknown** to you.

Here is an example of an **unknown-unknown**:
> What material was used to create the pigment used in the paint for the ushabti boxes created by Khabekhnet?

Until you read that sentence, you may very likely have never seen the word “ushabti”, and likely have no idea what a “ushabti box” is.
You probably have also never heard of “Khabekhnet”, and have no idea who he is.

Before reading that sentence, “ushabtis”, “ushabti boxes”, and “Khabekhnet” were **unknown-unknowns** to you.

Before reading that sentence, in a practical sense, you wouldn't have been able to even conceive of any direct question about “ushabtis”, “ushabti boxes”, and “Khabekhnet”.

After reading that sentence, you might have the question:
> What is an “ushabti”?

But before you read that sentence you wouldn't have known to ask that question.
Before you read that sentence “ushabti” was an **unknown-unknown** to you.

After reading that sentence, you might have the question:
> What is an “ushabti box”?

But before you read that sentence you wouldn't have known to ask that question.
Before you read that sentence “ushabti” was an **unknown-unknown** to you.

After reading that sentence, you might have the question:
> Who is “Khabekhnet”?

But before you read that sentence you wouldn't have known to ask that question.
Before you read that sentence “ushabti” was an **unknown-unknown** to you.

You will experience this a lot when doing **research interviewing**.

And it doesn't matter whether that **research interviewing** is for product-research, or ux-research, or business-analysis, or software-engineering.

### Questions

**You need to be able to discover _unknown-unknows_!**

But fear not — **phase 1** is partially intended to help us discover _unknown-unknowns_.

Here is a way you can go about discovering **unknown-unknows** —

1. **ask very open-ended questions, so that you can**
2. **just get the interviewee to start talking**; and
3. **let the interviewee talk**; and
4. **if the interviewee stops talking, ask them another open-ended question to get them talking again**.

What is an **open-ended question** you might be asking. Good question.

Here is an example of a question that is NOT an open-ended question:
> How old are you?

They will reply with something like:
> 35
And after saying that will likely _not_ say anything else.

The question:
> How old are you?
… is a **direct** question.

Don't ask that type of questions during **phase 1**.
Leave that type of question (i.e., _direct questions_) for **phase 3**.

You want the interviewee to start talking.
You want the interviewee to start talking about things you don't know you need to ask questions about.

Here is an example of an open-ended question:

* **Tell me about “X”.**
  * Tell me about _your experience as a YouTuber_.
  * Tell me about _what it is like to work at a bank_.
  * Tell me about _underwriting_.
  * Tell me about _EFTs_.
  * etc

(What you replace “X” with will depend on who you are talking to, and what industry or market you are researching.)

Here is an example of another open-ended question?

* **What is “X” like?**
  * What is _being a YouTuber_ like?
  * What is _working at a bank_ like?
  * What is _underwriting_ like?
  * etc

(Again, what you replace “X” with will depend on who you are talking to, and what industry or market you are researching.)

Questions like these — open-ended questions — are designed to get the person to talk, so that you can discover **unknown-unknowns**.

**What other open-ended question could you ask the interviewee?**

### Summary

Here is a summary of what you need to do and _not_ do in **phase 1**:

* ask open-ended questions
  * _“Tell me about ‘X’.”_
  * _“What is ‘X’ like?”_
  * _“What do you think about ‘X’.”_
  * etc
* do _not_ ask direct questions
* if you think of any direct questions (during phase 1) write them down (and ask them in phase 3)
* take notes
  * Take Notes!
  * TAKE NOTES!!!
  * you are wasting your time if you do not take notes, so — TAKE NOTES!!!!!
* if the interviewee mentions something that you want to know more about, make notes of that, and then ask about it in **phase 2**.

## Phase 2

**Follow-Ups**

While you were in **phase 1**, asking the interviewee open-ended questions, you probably heard him or her talk about things that you wanted to know more about.

For example, maybe you were interviewing someone in the real-estate industry, and are in **phase 1** where you a just trying to get them to talk,
and you hear the interviewee say _“quantitative surveyor”_,
but have never heard that label before, and have no idea what it means or is.

Don't ask about the interviewee about that (_“quantitative surveyors”_) yet if they are still talking.
Let them talk.
Don't interrupt them.
Don't make them lose their train of thought.

**Make a note that you to talk more about that topic** (for example, _“quantitative surveyors”_, or whatever).

And then talk about that in **phase 2**.

But when you get to **phase 2** you want to start with open-ended questions, and only later get into more direct questions.

For example, your initial questions should be:

* _“Tell me about ‘X’.”_
  * _“Tell me about “quantitative surveyors”.”_

* _“What do you think about ‘X’.”_
  * _“What do you think about “quantitative surveyors”.”_

* _“What do other people think or say about ‘X’.”_
  * _“What do other people think or say about “quantitative surveyors”.”_

* Etc.

## Phase 3

**Known-Unknows.**

Before you did the interview, you probably have some direct questions in mind — now, in **phase 2**, is the time to ask them.


ask specific questions

TODO

## Phase 4

> **How could things go wrong?**

In **phase 3** that is the question you should ask.

For example —

If you were talking to a _talent agent_ who gets sponsorship deals for the successful YouTubers, you might ask —

> **How could things go wrong?**
> 
> ... with the influncer?
> 
> ... with advertisers?
> 
> ... with anything and any of it?

Some of how you phrase that is going to depend on the exact field, industry, and market you are focusing on.

But you will discover how you should phrase that in **phase 1** & **phase 2**.

If you were talking the VP of Innovation at a bank, and you were talking about integrations, you might ask —

> **How could things go wrong?**
> 
> ... with the integration?
> 
> ... with any of the partners?
> 
> ... with an active account?
> 
> ... etc?
> 
> ... with anything and any of it?

## Phase 5

Sometimes interviewees don't tell you everything, or aren't completely honest.

Maybe answering a question honestly would embarrass them, or make them feel shame, or make them feel guilt.
Or maybe answering a question honestly would violate a local taboo.
Etc.

So they don't answer honestly.

But you a honest need answer!

How do you get the truth in case like this‽ —
How do you make the comfortable to try to counteract social desirability bias‽ —

Here is a strategy for getting that type of information — 

**Don't make the question about them.**
**Make the question about others.**

Ask this question —

> **What do you think others would say?**

> **What do you think others think?**

## Phase 6

Once you are done all that, there is another question for you to ask them —

> **What question should I have asked you, but didn't?**

You can only ask this question at the end of the interview.
It won't work at the beginning.

You've been talking to them for a while.
They probably had some thoughts on things they might have thought would be useful for you to know, but the conversation just didn't go that way, and a good time never came up for them to mention it.

You are giving them a chance to mention it by asking them this question.

**Take _lots and lots_ of notes on what they say.**

Also, you can ask this question more than once.

For example, if you ask that once, and then give you an answer, you can then ask:

> **What _other_ question should have I asked you, but didn't?**

You can keep repeating that until they have no more questions.

## Phase 7

At the very end of your interview, after you have asked _all_ those _questions_, and taken _lots and lots_ of _notes_, you need to ask another question —

> **Who else should I talk to?**

> **Who else would you recommend?**

> **Are there a few other people you would recommend I talk to?**

This person you just interviewed probably knows other people in that field in that industry, in that market.
They very likely could recommend other people for you to talk to.

If they give you a list of other people, **write the names of those people down** (and any other information interviewee provides you).

And _after_ than, _after_ they have given you that list of people, then ask:

> **Could you introduce me to them?**

It is usually much easier to get someone to talk to you, if someone they know introduces you to them.

In addition to that, through this strategy, you can find a lot of (relevant) people to interview this way.

For example, if you start with 1 person,
and that person introduces you to 3 people,
and each of those individuals introduced you to 3 more people,
and each of those individuals introduced you to 3 more people —
then that is:
```
1 + 1×3 + ((1×3)×3) + (((1×3)×3)×3) =
1 + 3   + 9         + 27            =
40
```

Before you talk to all these people, yoy will very likely have learned a lot!

## Phase 8

While the interview is going on, i am **writing notes**.

I am writing as many notes as I can.

But often (especially when I'm taking notes on my phone) I cannot record everything.

After the meeting is done, the interview is still fresh on my mind.

At this point (in **phase 8**), after the interview is done, I then try to:

* write down notes anything I missed, and then
* try to write a more organized & accessible document based on all those notes.

**Do this while the interview is fresh on your mind.**
