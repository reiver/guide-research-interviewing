A guide on how to conduct interviews for research. These are the types of interviews that would be done by product researchers, UX designers, business analysts, and software engineers.

There are 6 phases to inteviewing:

* [phase 1: unknown-unknowns (just get them to talk)](#phase-1)
* [phase 2: known-unknowns (ask specific questions)](#phase-2)
* [phase 3: how could things go wrong?](#phase-3)
* [phase 4: what do you think others would say or think?](#phase-4)
* [phase 5: what question didn't I ask you, but should have?](#phase-5)
* [phase 6: who else should I talk to?](#phase-6)

## Phase 1

Unknown-Unknowns.

### Example of Known-Unknowns

There are known-unknowns, and there are **unknown-unknowns**.

Here is an example of a known-unknown:
> How old are you?

You know I have an age.
And it is **known** to you that my age is **unknown** to you.
That is a **known-unknown** — you **know** that my age has some value, but to you it is **unknown** what my age actually is.
But given this is an **known-unknown**, you could directly ask me:
> How old are you?

### Example of Unknown-Unknowns

But there are also **unknown-unknows**.

Unknown-unknowns are things that you couldn't directly ask me a question about it, because you don't even realize you don't know it ⁠— i.e., it is **unknown** to you, that these things are **unknown** to you.

Here is an example of an unknown-unknown:
> What material was used to create the pigment use in the paint for the ushabti boxes created by Khabekhnet?

Until you read that sentence, you may very likely have never seen the word “ushabti”, and likely have no idea what a “ushabti box” is.
You probably have also never heard of “Khabekhnet”, and have no idea who he is.

Before reading that sentence, “ushabtis”, “ushabti boxes”, and “Khabekhnet” were **unknown-unknowns** to you.

Before reading that question, you wouldn't have been able to even come up with a direct question about “ushabtis”, “ushabti boxes”, and “Khabekhnet”.

You will experience this a lot when doing **research interviewing**.

And it doesn't matter whether that **research interviewing** is for product-research, or ux-research, or business-analysis, or software-engineering.

### Questions

**You need to be able to discover _unknown-unknows_!**

Here is a way you can go about discovering **unknown-unknows** —

1. ask very open-ended questions, so that you can
2. just get them to start talking;
3. and let them talk;
4. if they stop talking, ask them another open-ended question to get them talking again.

What is an **open-ended question** you might be asking. Good question.

Here is an example of a question that is NOT an open-ended question:
> How old are you?

They will reply with something like:
> 35
And likely _not_ say anything else.

You want them to start talking.
You want them to start talking about things you don't know you need to ask questions about.

Here is an example of an open-ended question:

* Tell me about “X”.
  * Tell me about _your experience as a YouTuber_.
  * Tell me about _what it is like to work at a bank_.
  * Tell me about _underwriting_.
  * Tell me about _EFTs_.
  * etc

(What you replace “X” with will depend on who you are talking to, and what industry or market you are researching.)

Here is an example of another open-ended question?

* What is “X” like?
  * What is _being a YouTuber_ like?
  * What is _working at a bank_ like?
  * What is _underwriting_ like?
  * etc

(Again, what you replace “X” with will depend on who you are talking to, and what industry or market you are researching.)

Questions like these — open-ended questions — are designed to get the person to talk, so that you can discover **unknown-unknowns**.

## Phase 2

Known-Unknows.


ask specific questions

## Phase 3

## Phase 4

## Phase 5

## Phase 6

At the very end of your interview, after you have asked _all_ those _questions_, and taken _lots and lots_ of _notes_, you need to ask another question —

> Who else should I talk to?

> Who else would you recommend?

> Are there a few other people you would recommend I talk to?

This person you just interviewed probably knows other people in that field in that industry, in that market.

They very likely could recommend other people for you to talk to.

If they give you a list of other people, **write the names of those people down**.

And then ask:

> Could you introduce me to them?

It is usually much easier to get someone to talk to you, if someone they know introduces you to them.
